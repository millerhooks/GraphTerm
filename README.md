GraphTerm
====================================================
__An aspirational DevOps and Container IDE Concept__

![GraphTerm Screencast](https://github.com/millerhooks/GraphTerm/raw/master/docs/images/DockerGraphTerminalScreencast.gif)

A concept for recording videos about docker containers that seems
to be turning into an IDE.

I don't really have time to maintain this, but people might like it.
It was spawned from a set of lessons on Docker I was trying to write
but never finished. That maybe I'll post one day if I clean it up.

This was not written to be used in production or as a remote
administration utility. It was made for educational screencast
production and as a proof of concept I have for a DevOps IDE. If
you do anything dumb with it like host it on your servers to the open internet,
you may experience problems. It is still just that, a proof of concept,
but people seem to like it so I'm sharing it. I know the code is uggo,
I would love it someone helped clean that up and finished the DevOps IDE and
gifted me a Tesla. If wishes were fishes, eh?
